# OnBrand MVP v0.1
*AI-Powered Brand Personality Analyzer*

## üéØ Problem Statement

Most AI content tools provide generic analysis that sounds the same for every brand. **OnBrand** solves this by creating sophisticated, actionable brand personality profiles that capture the nuances of how different traits work together to create a unique brand voice.

## ‚ú® What OnBrand Does

OnBrand analyzes your brand across three core dimensions:
- **Casual ‚Üî Formal**: Communication style and tone
- **Playful ‚Üî Serious**: Approach to engagement and personality  
- **Simple ‚Üî Technical**: Complexity and depth of communication

Instead of generic analysis, OnBrand provides:
- **Trait Complementarity**: How your brand voice dimensions work together
- **Productive Tensions**: Where contrasts create an interesting human voice
- **Dominance Moments**: When different traits should lead your communication
- **Brand Voice Archetype**: Clear positioning and communication strategy

## üöÄ Current Features (v0.1)

- Interactive brand personality assessment (3-slider system)
- AI-powered personality synthesis using Claude 3.5 Haiku
- Professional brand voice analysis with actionable insights
- Secure API key management with environment variables

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Anthropic API key
- Required packages: `anthropic`, `python-dotenv`

```bash

with measured confidence. Technical depth is elegantly framed through a 
formal lens, creating authority without coldness.

Dominant Trait Moments:

```

## üé® Technical Approach

OnBrand differentiates through:

- **Sophisticated Analysis Framework**: Goes beyond simple sentiment to analyze trait interactions and communication strategy
- **Professional Output**: Consultant-grade brand voice descriptions ready for strategy documents

## üìà Commercial Applications

- **Content Creators**: Ensure content matches brand personality guidelines  
- **Brand Consultants**: Data-driven brand voice development and documentation
- **Agencies**: Scalable brand analysis for multiple clients

## üîß Built With

- **Python**: Core application logic and user interface
- **Anthropic Claude 3.5 Haiku**: AI-powered brand personality analysis. I will experiment with different Claude models over time.
- **python-dotenv**: Secure environment variable management
- **Professional Development Practices**: Git version control, environment security, incremental development

## üìù Development Notes

I build this project using a **pseudocode-first methodology**:
1. Complete user journey mapped in plain English
2. Logic refined and validated before coding
3. Incremental development with testing at each milestone
4. Professional security practices (environment variables, .gitignore)

## ü§ù Contributing

OnBrand MVP is currently in active development. Future versions will include expanded functionality and team collaboration features.

## üìÑ License

This project is part of a learning portfolio demonstrating professional programming practicies in Python, AI integration, and product development.

#### Why?

I am a content marketing professional with 12 years of experience in emerging technologies, most recently in Web3. With the explosion of AI solutions for marketing professionals, I have observed that most tools provide generic results that don't offer much value to marketers worthy of the name or recommendations that could be logged under the "AI slop" category. This is an attempt to leverage my domain expertise from a Bachelor's degree in Linguistics and an MSc in Marketing Communications, plus more than a decade's worth of hands-on experience to create AI-powered tools that actually get the job done for marketers.
